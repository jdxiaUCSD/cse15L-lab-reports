## 1. 
Input: 
`% ls`

Output:
`Hello.java	README		messages`

Absolute Path: /Users/goats/desktop/lecture1

This output was a result of the `ls` command listing all of the current files in the directory "lecture 1". The command defaults to lecture 1 because I didn't include another argument (directory) for it to examine. This is not an error.
